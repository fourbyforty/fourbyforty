## 1 - Code
### Goal
 * An aethetically pleasing, functional site (likely written in React)

### Right Now
* I am a software developer by trade,  primarily Java and Golang. 
* I have an understanding of HTML and CSS, however, to quote Linus Torvalds 2016 TED interview:

## 2- Run
### Goal
* Run a half marathon

### Right Now
* I can run about 4.5k non-stop. I hate every step. Sometimes I stop halfway to eat a Snickers.

### Right Now
* I can play the 'Heart and Soul' bassline with one finger. 

## 4- Draw

1. I will upload at least 2 update videos a week.
1. I'm happy for (and encourage) people to offer advice that might assist in me achieving my goals. I don't have to take it.
1. I will make my UI repo public so people can see my coding progress. I welcome reviews and constructive feedback from experienced developers. But not pull requests - I'm doing this myself.
1. If a library exists that can help me build the website I'll use it - I've no interest in reinventing the wheel.
1. I can add new rules when I damn well please.
1. My family come first.
1. I am entitled to fail. And fail spectacularly if required. I honestly have no idea if these are possible but as my old

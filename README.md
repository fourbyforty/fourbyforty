### Get Fitter
#### Goal
* Run a half marathon

#### Present level

## Rules
1. I am aware a better name for this site would be four by forty as I'm doing 4 things before I'm forty. But I'm doing 4 things a day for half an hour each. I can't be arsed doing 4*40 minutes everyday - I don't have the time. SO four time
1. This phase of the project ends when I turn 40 (April 2020). I am committed to doing this until that point
1. I may reasses these pursuits when I turn 40 .  I might set new goals in new areas. I might pack it it. Let's see how I feel then.
1. I'm goint to spend 2 hours a day across the pursuits. This does not mean I'll be doing all pursuits every day. I might do 1*30 across all tasks if I feel like it. Or I might do an hour fitness and an hour piano. I might do 2 hours of drawing. B
1. Attending classes realted to these pursuits count as time spent. (a one hour boxing class counds as 2*30 towards fitness)
1. I will upload at least 2 update video a week.
1. I'm happy for (and encourage) people to offer advice that might assist in me acheiving my goals. I don't have to take it.
1. I will make my UI repo public so people can see my coding progress. I welcome reviews and constructive feedback from expereiced developers. But not merge requests - I'm doing this myself.
1. Having said that, if a library exists that can help me build the website I'll use it - I've no interest in reinventing the wheel.
1. I can add new rules when I damn well please.
1. My family come first. If I need to miss some days due to family happenings then so be it

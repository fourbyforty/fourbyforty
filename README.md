# Four By Forty

I'm 38. My hedonistic 20's and ambitious early 30's have been replaced by suburban tedium, nappy changes (my kids, not my own) and watching Frozen. These days, my idea of fun is sitting down to reminisce about how I used to have fun.

But unlike my hair, I'm not giving up on me yet; there's still a chance for growth. 

I'm going to try to learn 4 new skills before I'm forty. I have no idea if these goals are even achievable. I am entitled to fail. And fail spectacularly if required. And I invite you to watch! 


## 1 - Code

I am a software developer by trade, primarily Java and Golang. However, to quote Linus Torvalds 2016 TED interview:
 > "I can't do UI to save my life. If I was stranded on an island ad the only way to get off that island was to make a pretty UI, I'd die there."


### Goals
 * To create an aesthetically pleasing, functional website (likely written in React) - fourbyforty.com.
 * I'm going to put the website online - bugs and all - at every step.
 * The website will eventually become the document of my progress across all the activities.  
 
## 2- Run

I can run about 4k non-stop at the moment. I hate every step. Sometimes I stop halfway to eat a Snickers.

### Goal
* Run a half marathon. I don't care how long it takes me as long as I run the whole way without stopping to walk/spew/cry


## 3 - Play

I used to play the piano. Between ages 5-10. I can't remember anything about it other than being able to play the bassline of 'Heart and Soul' with one finger. 

### Goal
* Playing at a grade 2-3 level 

## 4- Draw

I have no drawing skill. My biggest achievement in this area is that I own pencils and paper (although no pencil sharpener).

### Goal
* The simplest goal of all. All I want from this is that when I draw something, people can recognise what it is 

## Rules

1. These Pursuits should be complete and judged (by me) when I turn 40 (24th April 2020). 
1. I may reassess these pursuits when I turn 40. I might set new goals. I might pack it. I'll be old by then so should probably decide at that point.
1. I'm going to at least 12 hours a week across the pursuits. I've got two infants, a job and a dog. These 12 hours the only time I have left where I'm not dealing with some type of shit.
1. I will upload at least 2 update videos a week.
1. I'm happy for (and encourage) people to offer advice that might assist in me achieving my goals. I don't have to take it.
1. I will make my UI repo public so people can see my coding progress. I welcome reviews and constructive feedback from experienced developers. But not pull requests - I'm doing this myself.
1. If a library exists that can help me build the website I'll use it - I've no interest in reinventing the wheel.
1. I can add new rules when I damn well please.
1. During this process, my family come first. If I need to break the rules for a while due to family commitments then so be it.
